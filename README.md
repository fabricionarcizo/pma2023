# Programming Mobile Applications, MSc. 2023

This course is a hands-on introduction to programming of mobile applications. Building on basic JavaScript programming skills, React Native is introduced as the preferred framework for cross-platform mobile application development. The concept of Location-Based-Services is also introduced in combination with React Native and is explored hands-on, in combination with programming hardware components on the phone (e.g. camera component). Student work revolves around small weekly individual tasks and readings of React Native documentation (online resources and provided course material) and a group project (3-4 students) that will be carried out in the second half of the course.

## Description

The course has two main parts: 

The first part of the course provides a hands-on introduction to basic concepts and tools in support of smartphone application programming. In this first part, students, building on prior JavaScript programming knowledge, will work with React Native as the framework for developing cross-platform smartphone applications. They will engage in a series of smaller assignments progressing towards increasingly more advanced parts of the React Native (RN) framework. In this part three individual assignments need to be completed.  

The second part of the course is focused on gradually introducing Location-Based Services (LBS), Geolocation/Geofencing, and ways to program/control hardware components (e.g. GPS, camera, accelerometer), aiming to expand the possibilities of interacting with mobile devices. In this second half of the course a group project (3-4 students) will be conducted focused on programming and implementing a React Native application, through exploring and demonstrating knowledge on working with main RN components, navigation, LBS and programming of smartphone hardware components. In this latter part of the course, the gradual development of the group project will emphasise the construction of mobile app prototypes as vehicles for discussing the process of programming a mobile application with React Native as a tool, through components as building blocks and blackboxing processes. 

Overall, students will train how to prototype with code and slowly develop their ability to analyse, discuss, and make appropriate design decisions when prototyping a mobile app, starting from code as a design material. 

## Formal Prerequisites

Students enrolling in this course should have completed at least 7.5 ECTS in basic programming, where you have worked hands-on with e.g. sequential execution, expression, selection, repetition, testing and debugging, arrays, variables, objects, functions and classes in programming languages such as JavaScript (preferred), Python, Java or C ++, and know how to work with the terminal. 

KDDIT students who have passed ITU course Introduction to Programming in 2019 or later are eligible to take this course as an elective. 

Please note: Limited number of places available as elective. More places may become available in the course registration change-of-mind window. 

## Intended Learning Outcomes

After the course, the student should be able to:

- Apply state-of-the-art mobile application prototyping tools for developing and designing mobile interactions
- Apply React Native to programming mobile applications, focused on using RN components, page navigation, dynamic images and text, styles, programmatic control of phone sensors, and location-based services/geolocation
- Reflect on the process of programming a mobile application with React Native as a tool by using external component libraries and by breaking down code into components

## Learning Activities

he course consists of a series of lectures presenting and explaining elements of programming with React Native from a theoretical perspective. Each theoretical lecture is accompanied by exercise sessions focused on hands-on programming aiming to invite students to learn through practice. Thus, lectures and exercise sessions are closely linked by means of weekly programming student assignments introduced during the exercise sessions and completed either individually or in small groups of students.

In general, coursework advances in parallel with student work that includes individual exercises and a group project focused on developing a mobile application prototype. These frame the move from basic mobile application programming, towards more advanced prototyping for mobile interaction including a focus on location-based services. The group project is conducted in groups between 3-5 students. 

Groups are expected to present/demo and discuss their prototype work in-class during design-critique sessions conducted throughout the course. The following table presents the Fabricio's lectures plane:
| Week | Date | Lecture |
|--|--|--|
| 02 | 06/09/2023 | [From JavaScript to React Native](lecture02) |
| 05 | 27/09/2023 | Firebase to React Native |
| 08 | 25/10/2023 | Location-based services and Geolocation |
| 10 | 08/11/2023 | Camera and other Hardware Components |

## Course Literature

A textbook introducing the fundamentals of React Native mobile app design & implementation will be suggested (specific book title to be announced in due course). Note that the purchase of the book is optional, since the course is not developed around the book- neither the course exams. 

Relevant academic papers, web links and book chapters will be made available as uploads to LearnIT as the course and the student prototyping work moves forward.
